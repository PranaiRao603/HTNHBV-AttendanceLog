&copy; 2022 Pranai Rao<br><br> <!-- &copy; = (c) or copyright -->
## v1.0.0-public<br>

This is the first public release of the Attendance Log!<br>
### Features:
<ul>
  <li>Create a student ID</li>
  <li>Sign a student in or out</li>
  <li>Generate attendance report (*.txt)</li>
  <li>Clear daily temporary data</li>
  <li>Barcode Support!</li>
</ul><br>

### This program was designed for the Bala Gokulam program powered by Bharathi Vidyashram and Hindu Temple of New Hampshire. Bala Gokulam is a class held once a week. The purpose of the attendance log is to know who is present and who is absent. Once this data has been recorded and stored in the computer, the "temporary data" or in and out times no longer need to be stored in the database and can (should) be cleared before the next class.<br><br> 

### Student IDs can be entered by scanning a barcode containing their ID number. This will save much time when signing students in and out.<br><br>

### Note:<br>
- There is no delete student function because doing so will prevent the code from functioning properly.<br><br>

### You may reset to factory settings by replacing the CSVs in the home folder with the CSVs found in the /reset directory.<br><br>
